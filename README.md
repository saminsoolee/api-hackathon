# api-hackathon
A hackathon project utilizing the data from two public APIs to create.

Current Feature List:

2. A random quote is selected from a quote API to generate everytime the page is
loaded.
3. Real-time Conversion of the US Dollar to Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and Litecoin.
4. Use of the toFixed() method to shorten and round conversion rates.
5. Error Modal pops up when the AJAX call has failed.

Planned Additions:
1. Giving functionality to the buttons:

a. Once a button is clicked, a chart will appear below the table showing the
  trends of the specific Cryptocurrency (day, week, month, year) compared to the
  US Dollar.

b. Once a button is clicked, the most current events relating to the button will
  appear below the chart.
